Programming in Java.

Classes and objects.  "ClassObjectSample.java" -> java code file.

Class is a model to create objects.
Class is a blueprint to create objects.
Example: Person is a Class.

Objects are things that are created from classes.
Objects are real life entities.
Example: Tejas, Vivek etc. are objects that are created from Person class.

All objects will have the same attributes that are defined in the class.
like eye color, age, gender etc will be same, but it's value differs.



**** Syntax for creating a class ****


// class name should always begin with Cap letter.

public class Person {
    String gender;
    int age;

    void eat(){
        SOUT("I eat this way");
    }

    void dance(){
        SOUT("I dance this way!");
    }
}

***** creating an object ******


Person tejas = new Person();

______________________________________________

we can set values / attributes to an object by using dot operator.

tejas.dance();
tejas.age = 25;
tejas.gender = "Male";

Rules for classes and objects:

1. If we have public class in your file, name of the file should match the name of public class.
i.e. public class' name should be same as the filename.

2. Public class of your source file should have the main method.

^^^ We have to use "Constructors" to set the values of Object attributes.

3. We can use only one public class per source code file.

______________________________________________

Packages and imports.

Packages is a name space that organizes set of similar classes and interfaces.
Packages are like folders in our system where we organize stuff based on it's detail.
Like English movies in one folder, Hindi in another.

*** package creation ***

right click on SRC folder
create a new package
name it. Ex: course.mypackageA
Move the file to the created package. Drag and drop it and refactor.
Or, right click and move and select package and refactor.


Rule:

package should be the first line of the program.
import statements should be in between package and class declaration.


^^^ main method is the starting point of the program flow.
All the program does not have to have a main class in their code.
So, only one main method is enough for an application to run.

Access Modifiers in Java.

Public -> Any code, anywhere can access.
Protected -> code in same package and it's sub-classes from other package can access. (inheritance)
Default -> code in same package can access.
private -> code in same class can access.
