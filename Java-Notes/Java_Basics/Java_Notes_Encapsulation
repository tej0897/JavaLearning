Programming in Java

Encapsulation:

Showing necessary details.

We should not allow users to access class variables directly.
We should grant them access to methods which in turn uses variables.

So, encapsulation is declaring variables as private and making methods public
_______________________________________________________

Declare all class variables as Private.
Use Getters and Setters for making private variables accessable.
So, when we use this, (getName()), we can access Private variables.

If we want to set value for a Private variable, use Setter, i.e.
setName()
to print the values or retrieve the data, use get method

So, setter is used to initialize the values
getter is used to retrieve the values and use them.

We use IDE to create setters and getters

if we need few validators, we can set them in setters(), like
the type of input given for String (name) etc.

If we want to remove the option of users setting values of something,
we can just remove the setters. // to make it only readable
