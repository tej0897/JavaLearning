Programming in Java

Static Members:

Static members are those which belongs to the class and you can access these members without instantiating the class.
The static keyword can be used with methods, fields, classes (inner/nested), blocks.

Static members are for the class, not instances.
They are created when the class is loaded.

Static variable is common for all the variables in a class.
Instance variable is for a particular instance of a class.

Ex. Number of eyes can be a static variable for the "Person" class, since it is common for all the objects.

Another example:

Flight tickets.

Number of tickets available is static variable.
The tickets itself are instance variable.

Code:

Public class FlightTicket(){
    public int seatNumber;
    public static int availableSeats = 2;

    PSVM(String [] args){
        FlightTickets userOne = new FlightTickets();
        FlightTickets userTwo = new FlightTickets();
    }
}

_______________________________________________________

Example code:

package staticPkg;

public class FlightTicket {
    public int flightNumber;
    public int seatNumber;
    public String ticketType;
    public int tickerID;

    public static int availableSeats = 50;

    public FlightTicket(int flightNumber, int seatNumber, String ticketType, int tickerID) {
        this.flightNumber = flightNumber;
        this.seatNumber = seatNumber;
        this.ticketType = ticketType;
        this.tickerID = tickerID;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FlightTicket ticket1 = new FlightTicket(1111, 24, "Business", 1221);
        availableSeats--;
        FlightTicket ticket2 = new FlightTicket(1112, 26, "Economy", 1222);
        availableSeats--;
        FlightTicket ticket3 = new FlightTicket(1113, 25, "Business", 1223);
        availableSeats--;
        System.out.println("Number of seats available now are: " +availableSeats);
    }
}


here, all the attributes are unique / used as a instance variable for individual ticket numbers.
whereas the number of seats available are same for all the tickets.

_______________________________________________________

A static member cannot access a non-static member and vice-versa.

Static can be accessed directly by class name.
They can be accessed without created objects.
